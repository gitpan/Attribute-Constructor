Attribute/Constructor version 0.03
==================================

NAME

Attribute::Constructor - implementing constructors with attributes

SYNOPSIS

package SomeObj;
use Attribute::Constructor;

sub new : Constructor {
	my $self = shift;
	$self->{attribute1} = shift;
	$self->{attribute2} = shift;
}

--- Calling Code ----

# Will create the object with 'attribute1' and
# 'attribute2' being set to 'foo' and 'bar' respectively
my $new_obj = SomeObj->new( 'foo', 'bar' );
or
my $new_obj = $old_obj->new( 'foo', 'bar' );

DESCRIPTION

Declaring a method of an object as a constructor will cause the object
to be created, blessed, and returned to the calling code. This will allow
the constructor to look more like a "real" constructor from an OO language
that supports the idea of constructor with syntax.

The object is already returned to the calling code so there is no need to
return it. The first argument will be a reference to the new class instead
of a reference to the class so that it behaves more like a normal constructor
in the fact that it is a instance method not a class method.
